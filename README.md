# Project 3: Fat Camp

Who doesn't love eating? Are you a fan of Man vs Food? Fat Camp is an application that allows you to find the details of food challenges in Georgia. If you complete the challenge, click "complete" to rack up some fat points and compare with your friends. If you discover a food challenge and want to share with your friends, simply create a new challenge and every user will be able to view your discovery. 
## Disclaimer: We encourage you to challenge yourself, but please be concious of your own health

I would like to implement an alert before anything is deleted. I would also like to make the gears detail page a module instead of directing to a new page.
